    <img src="../images/carbonara.jpg" width="500">
    <p>Carbonara is a traditional Italian dish that exemplifies one of the tenets of the cuisine: simplicity. Composed of only a few ingredients, 
        quality of each individual component really gets to shine. Plus, it's dead simple to make. Serves two.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10oz spaghetti, preferably bronze die-cut</li>
            <li>4oz guanciale, or pancetta if unavailble, small dice</li>

        </ul><br>
    <h3>Preperation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a pot of generously salted water to a boil, and heat the olive skillet over medium heat</li>
            <li>Add pasta to the boiling water and cook until slightly short of al dente, ~7 minutes (defer to package instructions)</li>
            <li>While that cooks, add guanciale to the skillet and fry, stirring frequently until crisped and browned. Remove from pan, leaving the oil and turn heat to low</li>
            <li>Blend the cheese into the eggs, salting and adding a generous portion of black pepper</li>
            <li>When the pasta is at its desired doneness, reserve 1c of the water then drain. Add the pasta and guanciale to the skillet and cook, stirring over low heat for 1 minute</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from heat, then add the egg mixture, stirring constantly to prevent scrambling. Add pasta water as need until the mixture is creamy and cohesive</li>
            <li>Plate and garnish with extra cheese and black pepper</li>
