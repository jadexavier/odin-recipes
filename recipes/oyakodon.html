    <img src="../images/oyakodon.jpg" width="500">
    <p>Oyakodon is a traditional Japanese comfort dish. Literally 'parent and child bowl', the chicken and eggs pair with the slightly 
        sweet soy and sake sauce to make a dish that warms you up and teleports you back home in an instant. Serves 1.

            <li>1tsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>2oz sake</li>
            <li>1oz mirin</li>
            <li>3oz soy sauce</li>

    <h3>Preperation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the sesame oil in a nonstick skillet, then add chicken and saute for 3-4 minutes until outside is fully cooked, adding onion after a minute.</li>
            <li>Add liquids and let come to a simmer for another 3 min, the slowly drizzle in the egg, agitating midair with chopsticks to evenly distribute.</li>\
            <li>Cover and let cook for 1-3 minutes, keeping an eye on the egg. The goal is to just barely set but still pourable.</li>
            <li>Transfer directly from pan to the top of a bowl of rice, all liquid included. Garnish to taste and enjoy.</li>
